CSS Positions:

1. fixed => Element position fixed even on mouse scroll
-> Tell position also fixed from where
-> Eg. top, bottom, right, left: distance from that direction
-> Eg. position: fixed; top: 10px; (Fixed element 10px from top)

2. sticky => Element position fixed from the position you give
-> Again tell position beyond which you want it fixed
-> Eg. position: sticky; top: 10px; (Beyond top, it'll be fixed)

3. absolute => Element that is absolute floats over on top of other elements
-> Tell the position to float over
-> It is not fixed, moves w.r.t screensize
-> Eg. position: absolute; top: 0px;

4. relative => Element position relative to outer element
-> Imagine a small box inside big box 
-> Parent class should be position: relative and child class should be position: absolute and now locate this child class or smaller box anywhere (top, bottom, left, right) w.r.t parent class or big box
-> relative and absolute MUST be in the same div

default => static (default position: static)
